# Remove Command
# Usage: /remove \[targets]
Removes entities from existence. Effectively like killing them, 
but they don't drop dead and don't drop items or xp.  
**Does not work for players as that causes many issues.**

## Parameters
- **Targets**
  + Type: `entity selector`
  + Default: `@s (command sender)`
  + The entities to remove from existence

## Example
`/remove @e[type=!player]`
