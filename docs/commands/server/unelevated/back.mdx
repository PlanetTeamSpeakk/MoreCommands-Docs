# Back Command
# Usage: /back
Teleports you to the last place you were at.

## Parameters
This command has no parameters.

## Example
`/back`

:::danger Inaccurate
Since Minecraft has no method for actual teleportation that's widely used,
the back command assumes you've teleported when you've either moved a large distance in a
single tick, if you changed dimensions or if you died.  
**This means all sorts of nonsense will happen if you're cruising around your world
at mach 10 using the [Speed Command](../elevated/speed).**
