# Send Chat Command
# Usage: /sendchat <msg\>
Sends a message as a chat message, regardless of if it should be treated as a command.

  + Type: `string`
  + Default: none, this parameter is required.
  + The message to send.

## Example
`/sendchat /help is what you're looking for.`

:::danger 1.19+
Starting from 1.19, chat messages and chat commands must be signed. As a side effect, they are
now no longer treated identically and commands use a separate type of packet.  
Because of this, this command can exist which means that this command cannot work on versions
older than 1.19.
