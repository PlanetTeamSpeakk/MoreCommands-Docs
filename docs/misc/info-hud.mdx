# Info Hud
MoreCommands offers a Heads-Up Display that can display a lot of information about what's 
going on around you in your Minecraft world.  

The default key to toggle it is `O` and this can be changed in the Minecraft controls screen.  
The config file for this HUD can be found at `<minecraft directory/config/MoreCommands/infoHud.txt`.

## Variables
The Info HUD also supports a couple variables which may change how or where the text is rendered.  
These variables can be set by having a single line as follows: `var <variable> = <value>`.  

The variables currently available are as follows:
- `xOffset`: the horizontal offset at which to start rendering the HUD.
- `yOffset`: the vertical offset at which to start rendering the HUD.

Starting from version 4.0, you also have the following variables:
- `scale`: the scale at which to render the HUD, 1.0 is default, anything below this is smaller.
- `backgroundOpacity`: the opacity of the background drawn behind the HUD, 0 by default as there isn't one. 100 at max
- `backgroundColour`: the hex colour of the background, may start with a #.

Example using all variables:
```
// Have a look at https://morecommands.ptsmods.com/misc/info-hud to see what variables you can use here.
var xOffset = 2
var yOffset = 2
var scale = 0.75
var backgroundOpacity = 25
var backgroundColour = #00ABBA
{DF}Player: {SF}{playerName}
{DF}FPS: {SF}{fps}
{DF}X: {SF}{x}
{DF}Y: {SF}{y}
{DF}Z: {SF}{z}
{DF}Pitch: {SF}{pitch}
{DF}Yaw: {SF}{yaw}
{DF}Facing: {SF}{facing}
{DF}Biome: {SF}{biome}
{DF}Speed: {SF}{avgSpeed}
```

## Comments
The Info HUD config also supports comments.  
Any line starting with two slashes (`//`) is completely ignored and any part of any line after 
two slashes is also ignored.  

E.g.
```
// This line is ignored
{DF}Player: {SF}{playerName} // This part will not be rendered.
```
