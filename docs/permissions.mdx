# Permissions
MoreCommands has full [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net) integration and you are encouraged to 
use it alongside this mod when running on a server.  

All server commands use a permission that's just their name prepended with `morecommands.`.
(E.g. for the vault command, it's `morecommands.vault`.)  
For [Elevated Commands](./category/elevated), this permission is by default only granted 
to operators.

Aside from that, a couple commands also have extra permissions, often to use the command on 
other players. (E.g. `morecommands.spawn.others`, `morecommands.enderchest.others`, etc.)

The [Vault Command](./commands/server/unelevated/vault) has special extra permissions, namely: 
+ `morecommands.vault.max.<i>` where `<i>` is a number between 1 and 100 (exclusive).  
  This permission denotes the amount of vaults a player may have. The default for this
  is dictated by the `vaults` gamerule. <!-- TODO link gamerule -->
+ `morecommands.vault.rows.<i>` where `<i>` is a number between 1 and 6 (inclusive).  
  This permission denotes the amount of rows a player's vaults must have. The default is `6`.
